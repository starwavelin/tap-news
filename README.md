### Project Description
This is a full-stack news mining and recommendation web application. It uses **React** for the front-end, **Node.js** for the web service and **Service-oriented** pattern of **Python** backend. I applied the frequently used Python libraries, deployed and connected **MongoDB** and **RabbitMQ**, and utilized web crawling to obtain news. At the meantime, I implemented **TF-IDF** to remove duplications over texts and **CNN** to realize news recommendation. At the end, I used **TensorFlow** to realize the News Topic Modeling, and deployed TensorFlow Serving to provide online prediction.


### Use Cases


### Learning Outcomes 

1. [] Understood the workflow and difficult points of web crawling and page data extraction, and learned how to use web crawling to obtain the information I actually needed.
2. [] Understood and mastered the React framework, and knew how to build a site using React front-end framework.
3. [] Became familiar with the **Service Oriented Architecture** and knew how to use this architecture to design a system.
4. [] Became familiar with the use of Message Queue, learned how to deploy and connect RabbitMQ, and used RabbitMQ for load balancing.
5. [] Learned the basic knowledge on **Text Mining**, using TF-IDF for text de-duplication.
6. [] Understood the fundamental theory and workflow of **Machine Learning**, became familiar with several common machine learning problems and models, mastered the basic **Deep Learning** skills and the use of TensorFlow, and learned how to use CNN to implement a recommendation system. 
7. [] Mastered the Python libraries, and learned how to use **RPC** to build a Python backend.
